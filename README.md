<u><b>Tools Required</b></u>
============================

- PBO tool which can be found in the tools folder.<br>
(NOTE: Make sure before you pack to the .pbo, you set the prefix to "z\addons\dayz_server")

<b>How To Pack PBO Correctly With PboManager</b>
- Open PboManager
- Right click dayz_server folder and select PBO Manager>Pack into "dayz_server.pbo"
- After packing the folder, click the green icon on PboManager and open the "dayz_server.pbo" you just packed.
- Next click on the blue icon to check the file properties.
- If you see "prefix" and "z\addons\dayz_server", your ok.
- If you don't see it, your still ok, right click the white area and select "Add".
- Under property, add "prefix", and under value, add "z\addons\dayz_server" (without the quotes)
- Close the PboManager and upload the file if you didn't pack it on the server.
- Now restart the server.


<u><b>Installing Database:</b></u>
============================

- You need to have MySQL version 5.5 and up. 
(Work great on  5.5.31-0+wheezy1 (debian). Older version have problem importing the .SQL file)
- For Windows servers, Navicate + MYSQL 5.5 and up works pretty good.
- Import \sqlfile\dayz_origins.sql into your database

(NOTE: If your having issues installing the functions, and get a message saying you don't have permission to install, you must install the functions as a 'root' user)


<u><b>Installing Files:</b></u>
============================

- Install OA Beta Patch 103419 (http://www.arma2.com/beta-patch.php)
- Create a new folder copy the files from the OA folder into it. (This help retains your original files if you have to start over)
- Copy the Addons folder from the Arma 2 folder into the same folder.
- Copy the map (@DayzOrigins) into the same folder. (Downloaded from Dayz Commander or other tool)
- Edit the following files:<br>
--- \dayz_1.origins.tavi\config.cfg<br>
--- \dayz_1.origins.tavi\HiveExt.ini<br>
--- \dayz_1.origins.tavi\BattlEye\BEServer.cfg<br>
--- \MPMissions\dayz_1.origins.tavi\Debug\player_spawn_2.sqf (More Details Below)<br>
--- \MPMissions\dayz_1.origins.tavi\Camera\loginCamera.sqf (More Details Below)<br><br>


<u><b>Editing player_spawn_2.sqf:</b></u>

Look for 'Visit: www.epm-gaming.co.uk' on line 361, 385, and 416, and change it to your own website.


<u><b>Editing loginCamera.sqf:</b></u>

Look for:
<pre>
_welcomeMessage = format["Welcome to EPM Gamings's GB 500 #2 Server %1, Enjoy your stay!",format["%1", name player]];
</pre>

Edit this line.


- Copy all the files from your git download into your folder. (Make sure to maintain the same file structure)
- Install your PBO tool if you haven't already.
- Use the PBO tool to pack the \@dayz_1.origins.tavi\addons\dayz_server folder.
(NOTE:  You can also pack the folder in the MPMissions folder, but it isn't required)


<u><b>Optional How-Tos</b></u>
============================

<b>Adjusting Day/Night Time<b>

- Edit \MPMissions\dayz_1.origins.tavi\init.sqf
- Look for:
<pre>
[4,true,true] execFSM "core_time.fsm";
</pre>
- Default is currently 3hr day/night.
- Other examples:<br>
--- [4,true,true] execFSM "core_time.fsm"; (3hr day/night)<br>
--- [3,true,true,12] execFSM "core_time.fsm"; (4hr day / 1 hr night)<br>
- To disable completely, just add a double slash to the front of the line '//'

<b>Auto Refuelling<b>

To enable auto refuelling:
- Edit \MPMissions\dayz_1.origins.tavi\init.sqf
- Look for:
<pre>
	//Remove the double slashes on the line below to enable auto refuelling
	//[] execVM "Scripts\kh_actions.sqf";
</pre>
- Remove the double slashes to enable the add-on, save and restart the server.
(NOTE:  Folders inside the \MPMissions\ folder don't have to be packed to .pbo format)

<b>DMR Damage Scaling Removed</b>

- Edit file: MPMissions/dayz_1.origins.tavi/BASTARDS/fn_damageHandler.sqf<br>
- Look at lines 81-88.
-If you would like DMR's to have the same damage as they would in cherno
then keep or delete lines that are commented out starting with  "  /* if
(_unit == player) then { "  if you want the new style DMR damage they
uncomment out the code.

<b>Increasing/Decreasing Zombies</b>

- Edit \MPMissions\dayz_1.origins.tavi\BASTARDS\player_spawnCheck look for:
- On line 5:
<pre>
_maxZombies = 25;
</pre>
Further down the page:
<pre>
switch (_nearbytype) do {
    default {
        _maxZombies = 10;
    };
    case "NameLocal": {
        _maxZombies = 10;
    };
    case "NameVillage": {
        _maxZombies = 15;
    };
    case "NameCity": {
        _maxZombies = 20;
    };
    case "NameCityCapital": {
        _maxZombies = 20;
    };
};
</pre>
- Edit the values to your preference.
