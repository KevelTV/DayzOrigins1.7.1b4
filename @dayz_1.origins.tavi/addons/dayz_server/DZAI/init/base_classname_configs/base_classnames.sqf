/*
	Description: Basic tables containing AI equipment classnames and skin models used by AI units. Some settings may be overridden by map-specific configuration files in the loot_configs folder.
	
	Important Notes: EDIT WITH CARE - these tables affect ALL DayZ mods globally. 
	To make changes for a specific DayZ mod, edit the appropriate config file in configs folder. 
	
	Rule of thumb: If it doesn't belong in the original DayZ mod, it doesn't belong here. Edit the mod-specific config file instead.
	
	Note on Weapons: Weapon classname arrays are dynamically generated by DZAI and do not need to be manually added in any file. To ban specific weapons from use by AI, edit DZAI_banAIWeapons in dzai_variables.sqf.
